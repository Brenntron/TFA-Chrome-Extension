# TFA-Chrome-Extension
A chrome extension that will tell you if The Force Awakens has premiered.

To see it in action go to `chrome://extensions` and click   `Load unpacked extensions`.
Then select the directory. The extension will be added to your
toolbar (it's the small Death Star, you can't miss it.).
